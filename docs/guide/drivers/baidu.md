# Baidu Netdisk

:::tip
Due to the limitation of Baidu Disk API, downloading files larger than about 20M needs to carry the header: "User-Agent": "pan.baidu.com", so when downloading files larger than 20M, you need to set the request header yourself, such as using curl:
```bash
curl -L -X GET 'YOUR_LINK' -H 'User-Agent: pan.baidu.com'
```
Or use the proxy function in this program to transfer.

## **Refresh token**
[Click here](https://openapi.baidu.com/oauth/2.0/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=hq9yQ9w9kR4YHj1kyYafLygVocobh7Sf&redirect_uri=https://alistgo.com/tool/baidu/callback&scope=basic,netdisk&qrcode=1) to get the refresh token.

## **Storage Update**
The Baidu Netdisk client ID and secret have been updated. You only need to update these in your AList storage settings to restore normal mounting and usage of Baidu Netdisk. Please refer to the image below for detailed instructions.
- Client ID: hq9yQ9w9kR4YHj1kyYafLygVocobh7Sf

- Client Secret: YH2VpZcFJHYNnV6vLfHQXDBhcE7ZChyE

## **Root folder path**
The root foler to mount, defaults to `/`

- Mount a folder separately, according to the following format, `/` is the root directory, just extend to that directory if you want to mount that directory
  - /folder_A/....../folder_x

## ~~**Custom crack ua**~~

~~[**UA used when using 【Native Proxy & Crack API】**](https://github.com/alist-org/alist/issues/5602#issuecomment-1831188682)~~ The unofficial interface is no longer available

<br/>



## **Download api**

- Official: The official interface, very stable, but for larger files, UA needs to be modified and the speed is slow (SVIP speed fast)
- Crack: unofficial interface，**Seems to be no longer available** ~~You must modify the UA and some files may not have a speed limit, but it will be unstable (not guaranteed 100%availability) Need to use a version greater than `3.19.0`~~
  -  ~~==Need to change the UA to`netdisk`==，Modification method refer to [add-user-agent-user-example](#add-user-agent-usage-example)~~
  -  ~~Or turn on the Web proxy, you do not need to modify the UA (you need a large broadband to use it stably)~~
  -  ~~It is limited to play/download **`video (only tested in the mp4 format other formats are not tested)`**,If it is other format files, such a prompt will appear~~
  -  ~~This is not a mistake, this is a limit, please do not panic.~~
  
- Crack video: unofficial video interface, dedicated to playing videos, the following errors will occur in non-video formats, which is normal
  - The browser also needs to modify the UA: `pan.baidu.com` or `netdisk` In short, if it is not the browser User-Agent, the video can be played.
  
  - The specific situation is the same as the previous unofficial interface usage
  - ==The continuous use time is unknown, and 100% availability is not guaranteed==
  

```json{2-4,7-9}
{
	error_code: 31119,
	error_msg: "hit black userlist , hit illeage dlna",
	request_id: 541111111111111140
},
{
	error_code: 31329,
	error_msg: "hit black userlist , hit illeage dlna",
	request_id: 921111381111111100
}
```

## **Add "User-Agent" usage example**

::::danger If you don't know how to set "User-Agent" see here

 ==The following methods are limited to Baidu super member users== 

 ==Prompt again The following methods are limited to Baidu super member users== 

It will only be useful if a member finishes modifying **`"User-Agent"`** (choose official and 302)

If you don't change **`"User-Agent"`**, you can enable ==Web Agent==, the disadvantage is that you need to build an Alist machine for transfer, that is to say, you need a large broadband to help you transfer

@tab Web plugin

- The advantage of using a browser plug-in to modify is that it can be played directly online, of course, downloading is also possible.

Example <Badge text="1" type="info" vertical="middle" />: If you really don't know it, you can take a look at an example on the web page: **https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1UA4y1X7J8**

Example <Badge text="2" type="info" vertical="middle" />: Another plugin method covering 360, Chrome, Edge: **https://youtu.be/PP6b0WSzYMc**

## **Upload Config**

Official Documentation: [百度网盘开放平台 - 上传 - 能力说明](https://pan.baidu.com/union/doc/3ksg0s9ye)

> Baidu Netdisk requires that each slice be uploaded within 30 seconds, so excessively high concurrency during file uploads may result in a significant number of failures.

- Upload Threads: The number of slices to upload concurrently.
- Upload API: The domain endpoint used for uploading.
- Custom Upload Slice Size: Allows you to specify the size of each slice. Note that there are limitations, and this feature is available to VIPs only.
- Low Bandwidth Upload Mode: Attempts to address the frequent `Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers` errors encountered in low upload bandwidth scenarios (e.g., residential broadband). When enabled, it uses the smallest possible slice size.
